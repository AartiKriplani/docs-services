Extending Cloud Foundry
========

This guide explains how to extend a Cloud Foundry instance with user-supplied services and custom buildpacks. 
Other guides include:

*  [Deploying Applications](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/docs-dev-guide): a guide for developers on deploying and troubleshooting applications running in Cloud Foundry. Note that this content is shared with the open source context and therefore will have the name Cloud Foundry throughout.

More coming soon.
