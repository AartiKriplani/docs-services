## <a id='async-flow'></a>Asynchronous Operations Summary #

Previously, the Cloud Controller only supported a synchronous integration with service brokers. This means that the service broker must return a valid response to all requests within 60 seconds. For provisioning requests, a success response implies the service instance has been created and is useable.

With this change, the Cloud Controller also supports asynchronous broker integrations. This means the service broker can respond that the requested operation is accepted but not completed, triggering Cloud Controller to poll the `last_operation` endpoint until the broker indicates that the requested operation has succeeded or failed. During this time, end users are able to discover the state of the requested operation using Cloud Controller API clients.

For an operation to be executed asynchronously, all three components (CC API client, CC, and broker) must support it. The parameter `accepts_incomplete=true` must be passed in a request from the CC API client, through the Cloud Controller, and finally to the service broker for an asynchronous operation to be initiated. The broker can choose to execute the request synchronously or asynchronously.

To trigger the asynchronous operation flow, the broker response must have status code `202 ACCEPTED` -- the response body should be the same as if the broker were serving the request synchronously. If the "accepts_incomplete" parameter is not included, and the broker can not fulfill the request synchronously (guaranteeing that the operation is complete on response), then the broker should reject the request.

To use the usual synchronous flow, the broker need only return the usual 200/201 status code.

</a>

### <a id='blocking'></a>Blocking other operations ##

The Cloud Controller will ensure that service brokers do not receive requests for an instance while an asynchronous operation is in progress. For example, if a broker is in the process of provisioning an instance asynchronously, the Cloud Controller will not allow any update, bind, unbind, or deprovision requests to be made through the platform. A user who attempts to perform one of these actions while an operation is already in progress will get an HTTP 400 with error message "Another operation for this service instance is in progress."

##  <a id='updated-apis'></a>Changes to existing APIs

Below are the changes to existing Broker API endpoints to include asynchronous operations. Note that these only include changes (such as new parameters, status codes, etc.), and do not represent the complete API.

### When to use asynchronous service operations

Brokers that can guarantee completion of an operation in less than a minute should return the synchronous response (for example, `201 CREATED` for a provision request). If not, brokers should implement support for asynchronous provisioning. Regardless, brokers should respond to all Cloud Controller requests within 60 seconds.

If the broker supports asynchronous operations, and `?accepts_incomplete=true` was included in the request, it should return the asynchronous response `202 ACCEPTED`.

Brokers that only support asynchronous operations should reject requests that do not include `?accepts_incomplete=true` with a response of `422 UNPROCESSIBLE ENTITY` and body:

<pre class="terminal">
{
  "error": "AsyncRequired",
  "description": "This service plan requires client support for asynchronous service operations."

## <a id='polling'></a>New API Endpoint: Polling Service Instance Last Operation##

When a broker returns a 202 for `provision`, `update`, or `deprovision`, the Cloud Controller will begin to poll the `/v2/service_instances/:guid/last_operation` endpoint for the service instance to obtain the state of the instance's last operation from the broker. The broker response must contain two fields: the operation's `state` and an optional `description`.

Accepted values of `state` are "in_progress", "succeeded", and "failed". The optional `description` field will simply be passed through to the client. The Cloud Controller will poll this endpoint as long as the broker returns `"state": "in progress"`. Returning `"state": "succeeded"` or `"state": "failed"` will cause Cloud Controller to cease polling.

### Route #####
`GET /v2/service_instances/:instance_id/last_operation`

##### cURL #####
<pre class="terminal">
$ curl http://username:password@broker-url/v2/service_instances/:instance_id/last_operation
</pre>

### Response ###

<table border="1" class="nice">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Status Code</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>200 OK</td>
  <td>The expected response body is below.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>410 GONE</td>
  <td>Appropriate only for asynchronous delete requests, in which case Cloud Controller will consider this response a success and remove the resource from its database. The expected response body is <code>{}</code>. Returning this while Cloud Controller is polling for create or update operations will be interpreted as an error, causing Cloud Controller to keep polling.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Responses with any other status code will be interpreted as a failure. Brokers
can include a user-facing message in the `description` field; for details see
<a href="api.html#broker-errors">Broker Errors</a>.

##### Body #####

All response bodies must be a valid JSON Object (`{}`). This is for future compatibility; it will be easier to add fields in the future if JSON is expected rather than to support the cases when a JSON body may or may not be returned.

For success responses, the following fields are valid.

<table border="1" class="nice">
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Response field</th>
  <th>Type</th>
  <th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>state*</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>Valid values are <code>in progress</code>, <code>succeeded</code>, and <code>failed</code>. While <code>"state": "in progress"</code>, Cloud Controller will continue polling. A response with <code>"state": "succeeded"</code> or <code>"state": "failed"</code> will cause Cloud Controller to cease polling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>description</td>
  <td>string</td>
  <td>Optional field. A user-facing message displayed to the cloud controller client. Can be used to tell the user details about the initial status of the provision request.</td>
</tr>

{
  "state": "in progress",

}
</pre>

### <a id='polling-interval'></a> Polling Interval ###
After making an asynchronous request (request in which the client specifies accepts_incomplete=true), the Cloud Controller will fetch operation progress at a configured polling interval. The Cloud Foundry operator can configure a minimum interval in the manifest (default 60 seconds). The maximum supported polling interval is 86400 seconds (24 hours).

### <a id='polling-timeout'></a> Polling Timeout ###
After making an asynchronous request (request in which the client specifies accepts_incomplete=true), Cloud Controller will continuously poll for a maximum duration before declaring the operation failed. This number can be configured by the Cloud Foundry operator (default 10080 or 1 week).
